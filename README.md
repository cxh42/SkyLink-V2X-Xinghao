### Some useful tools for scenario design


## Customize your agent autonomy

Agent autonomy includes **Perception**, **Localization**, **Mapping**, **Planning**, and **Control**. Each portion support flexibly inferface for both rule-based and deep-learning based algorithms

For instruction will be release later.

## Customize your communication

Skylink support multiple types simulation regarding communincation robustness, including **package loss**, **communication latency**, **adversarial attack**, **agent disconnection**, **sensor drop**, etc.

More instruction will be release later.
